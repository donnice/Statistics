Name  | Description
----- | -----------
Simple random sampling | any particular sample of a specified sample size has the same chance of being selected as any other sample of the same size. 
Sample size | the number of elements in the sample
Treatments | the populations to be studied or compared in some sense 
Estimate | sample mean
Fundamental assumption | upon which the resulting statistical inference is based
observational study | a kind of study without factor control
retrospective study | study uses strictly historical data, data taken over a specific period of time



**Keywords:**

biased sample, experimental design, variability,
experimental unit, completely randomized design,
process variability, population parameters, population mean, population variance, postulated model, Gaussian distributions, regression model, estimation theory, exploratory data analysis, violation of assumptions, stem-and-leaf plot, relative frequency distribution, box-and-whisker plot, outlier
```

**Literal Definitions:**

* The sample along with iinferential statistics allows us to draw conclusion about the population, with inferential statistics making clear use of elements of probability.
* Elements in probability allow us to draw conclusions about characteristics of hypothetical data taken from the population, based on known feature of the population.
