**Terms:**

Name  | Description
----- | -----------
Simple random sampling | any particular sample of a specified sample size has the same chance of being selected as any other sample of the same size. 
Sample size | the number of elements in the sample
Treatments | the populations to be studied or compared in some sense 
Estimate | sample mean
Fundamental assumption | upon which the resulting statistical inference is based
observational study | a kind of study without factor control
retrospective study | study uses strictly historical data, data taken over a specific period of time



**Keywords:**

```
biased sample, experimental design, variability,
experimental unit, completely randomized design,
process variability, population parameters, population mean, population variance, postulated model, Gaussian distributions, regression model, estimation theory, exploratory data analysis, violation of assumptions, stem-and-leaf plot, relative frequency distribution, box-and-whisker plot, outlier
```

**Literal Definitions:**

* The sample along with iinferential statistics allows us to draw conclusion about the population, with inferential statistics making clear use of elements of probability.
* Elements in probability allow us to draw conclusions about characteristics of hypothetical data taken from the population, based on known feature of the population.

**Terms:**

Name  | Description
----- | -----------
Categorical data | be classified according to some criterion
observation | recording of data
Experiment | any process that generates a set of data
Sample space | The set of all possible outcomes of a statistical experiment
Element | each outcome in a sample space
Event | a subset of a sample space
Complement | the complement of an event A with respect to S is the subset of all the elements of S that are not in A, Or A'
Intersection | The intersection of two events A and B is the event containing all the elements that are common to A and B
Disjoint | if A and B have no elements in common
Union | event containing all the elements that belong to A or B or both
Permutation | an arrangement of all or part of a set of objects
Weights | the likelihood of the occurrence of an event resulting from such a statistical experiment is evaluated by means of a set of real numbers
Conditional probability | the probability of an event B occurring when it is known that some event A has occurred

**Literal Definitions:**

* If an operation can be performed in n1 ways, and if for each of these ways a second operation can be performed in n2 ways, then the two operations can be performed together in n1n2 ways.* If an operation can be performed in n1 ways, and if for each of these a second operation can be performed in n2 ways, and for each of the first two a third operation can be performed in n3 ways, and so forth, then the sequence of k operations can be performed in n1n2 · · · nk ways.

* The probability of an event A is the sum of the weights of all sample points in A

* If an experiment can result in any one of N different equally likely outcomes, and if exactly n of these outcomes correspond to event A, then the probability of event A is P(A) = n/N

* That is, P(B|A) = P(B). When this is true, the events A and B are said to beindependent.
