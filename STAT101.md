Simple random sampling | any particular sample of a specified sample size has the same chance of being selected as any other sample of the same size. 
Sample size | the number of elements in the sample
Treatments | the populations to be studied or compared in some sense 
Estimate | sample mean
Fundamental assumption | upon which the resulting statistical inference is based
observational study | a kind of study without factor control

**Page 6:**

* The sample along with iinferential statistics allows us to draw conclusion about the population, with inferential statistics making clear use of elements of probability.
* Elements in probability allow us to draw conclusions about characteristics of hypothetical data taken from the population, based on known feature of the population.
